      <p class="font1">In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert
         information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened 
         or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. 
         An early example is an invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate
          what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the
           distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. 
           The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range 
           of communication across space and time. The process of encoding converts information from a source
            into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols
             back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish. One reason for coding
              is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is difficult
               or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the 
               arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters, and numbers. 
               Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.
